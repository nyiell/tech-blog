## 8. PRACTICAL PATHWAYS FOR NEW TECH NONPROFIT FOUNDERS

### 8.1 Build First vs. Funding First Decision Framework

**Build MVP First (Then Seek Funding):**

**Advantages:**
- Validation of vision
- Better negotiating position
- Demonstrates capability
- Can reduce development costs by 50%
- Attracts angel investors/foundations preferring established MVPs

**When to Choose:**
- Team has technical capacity to build
- Low initial infrastructure costs
- Can bootstrap for 3-6 months
- Open source or low-code approach

**Funding First (Then Build MVP):**

**Advantages:**
- Hire needed skills
- Access tools/infrastructure
- Faster development
- Pre-seed funding specifically for MVP development

**When to Choose:**
- Experienced founding team
- Lack critical technical skill
- High infrastructure costs (AI/ML, data processing)
- Can articulate vision compellingly

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
1. Validate concept minimally (prototype, design mockups)
2. Seek small seed funding ($5K-25K)
3. Build stronger MVP
4. Demonstrate traction
5. Seek larger funding ($100K+)

### 8.3 Fiscal Sponsorship Deep Dive

**What Is It?**
- Established 501(c)(3) provides tax-exempt status umbrella
- You accept donations immediately while building track record
- Sponsor handles compliance, accounting, 990s

**Two Models:**

**1. Comprehensive Model (recommended for most):**
- Project becomes part of fiscal sponsor legally
- Sponsor has full legal and fiduciary responsibility
- Example: NumFOCUS

**2. Grantor-Grantee Model:**
- Lighter weight
- For receiving specific grants
- Project remains separate entity

**Top Fiscal Sponsors for Tech:**

**Software Freedom Conservancy:**
- For FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) projects
- Manages 30+ projects (BusyBox, Git, Outreachy)
- Services: Financial stewardship, legal, events, license compliance

**NumFOCUS:**
- For scientific computing / data science projects
- Both comprehensive and grantor-grantee models
- Well-known in Python/R/Julia communities

**Open Source Collective:**
- Works with GitHub Sponsors
- Automatic monthly payouts
- Transparent platform

**Costs:**
- Typically 5-15% of donations
- Some charge flat fees
- Worth it to start accepting donations immediately

**When to Leave:**
- Once you have 2-3 years track record
- Annual budget >$250K
- Ready for administrative overhead
- Can afford 501(c)(3) application ($600 + legal costs)

---

### 8.4 Should You Build the Product First or Get Funding First?

**The Data Says:** Both work, choose based on your situation

**Factors Favoring Build First:**
- You/cofounder can code
- Low infrastructure costs
- 3-6 months personal runway
- Open source (community contributions possible)

**Factors Favoring Funding First:**
- No technical cofounder yet
- High compute costs (AI/ML)
- Need to hire developers
- Experienced team can pitch well

**Middle Path (Recommended for Most):**
1. **Validate (Week 1-4):** Design mockups, user interviews, proof of concept
2. **Seed funding (Month 2-3):** $5K-25K (Pollination, community foundation, crowdfunding)
3. **MVP build (Month 4-6):** Use seed to build/hire
4. **Demonstrate traction (Month 7-9):** Early users, metrics
5. **Larger funding (Month 10-12):** $50K-250K (foundations, accelerators)

---

### 8.5 Geographic Considerations

**Where to Incorporate:**
- Your home state (simplest)
- Delaware (if planning complex structure later)
- State where you'll operate (for community foundation access)

**Where to Seek Funding:**
- Start LOCAL (community foundations prioritize geographic area)
- Expand REGIONAL (state/multi-state foundations)
- Go NATIONAL (once you have track record)

**Underserved Geographic Markets:**
- Rural America (mental health tech, broadband access)
- Midwest tech hubs (growing but less saturated)
- International (if you have domain expertise and connections)

- **Solution:** Multiple revenue streams from day 1
- **Target:** 3+ sources by end of Year 1

**2. No Financial Controls:**
- **Problem:** Budget overruns, misallocation
- **Solution:** Monthly budget reviews, expense approval process

**3. Ignoring Economic Conditions:**
- **Problem:** Expenses rising, donations flat
- **Solution:** Reserves (3-6 months), scenario planning

---

### 11.3 Strategic Pitfalls

**1. Big Picture, No Plan (Very Common):**
- **Problem:** Identified gap but no execution roadmap
- **Solution:** Detailed business plan before launch
- **Include:** Milestones, metrics, contingencies

## CONCLUSION & FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Key Takeaways from 30+ Research Searches:

**1. Tech Nonprofits CAN Succeed Without Traditional VC:**
Signal ($105M single donor), OpenAI (started with $130M donations), Khan Academy ($62M+ from foundations) prove tech scale is achievable in nonprofit structure.

**2. Hybrid Models Are Increasingly Common:**
Mozilla (nonprofit + for-profit), OpenAI (capped-profit), and freemium approaches show mission and sustainability can coexist.

**3. First $100K Is Accessible:**
Fiscal sponsorship, small seed grants ($1K-25K), community foundations, accelerators ($25K-100K), and cloud credits can get you to $100K in Year 1.

**4. Credibility Beats Credentials:**
Moxie Marlinspike (Signal) and open source maintainers demonstrate that technical expertise, community trust, and demonstrated impact matter more than pedigree.

**5. Timing Matters:**
AI safety funding exploded 2024-2025. Watch for waves and ride them.

**6. Warm Introductions Are Gold:**
Board members, advisors, and YC/Fast Forward networks unlock doors. Build relationships before you need them.

**7. Diversification Is Survival:**
Single-source dependency is the #1 failure reason. Aim for 3+ sources by end of Year 1.

**8. Build in Public:**
Transparency, GitHub presence, technical blogging, and community engagement build trust and attract funders.
